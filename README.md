<h1> Kia Ora ðŸŒ¿ </h1>
<p> Nice To Meet You (Insert Us Shaking Hands In Your Head) </p>
<p> I am Jojo, 35 year old, a mother to a 2 year old daughter, from Wellington</p>
<p> I was in the banking industry for more than 8 years. I have a strong passion for lending and love helping people get into their first home or looking at purchasing their first investment property.
<p> Last week, I just resigned my corporate job and joined a coding bootcamp at Dev Academy. 
<p> Coding was always something I wanted to learn but there was never enough time, motivation or resources. So when the opportunity presented itself, I took it with both hands
<p> I have ideas around developing lending apps and platforms for the banking industry, which can make it easier for lenders to assess credit applications, while meeting compliance and credit policy requirements. I look forward to working with  my "coding friends", learning and growing. I hope to find a job as a junior developer when I complete the course
